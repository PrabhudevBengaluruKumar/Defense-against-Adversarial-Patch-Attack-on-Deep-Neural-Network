# Defense-against-Adversarial-Patch-Attack-on-Deep-Neural-Network
Comparative Evaluation of Adversarial Attacks and its Defense Mechanisms on Deep Neural Network

In this project Adversarial Patch attack is performed on three Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) namely,
1. MobileNetV2
2. ResNet50
3. VGG16

Then three defenses is implemented and evaluated on these 3 DNNs. Three defenses implemented in the project is,
1. Adversarial Training Defense
2. Abstention Class Defense
3. Evidential Uncertainty Estimation Defense

All the experiments are implemented in Python programming language using TensorFlow. Adversarial Patch attack is performed using python library called Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART).

Code of the project is present in the folder "Defenses". Report and presentation made is uploaded here.
